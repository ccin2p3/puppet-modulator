# Puppet Modulator

![modulator-logo-medium.png](images/modulator-logo-medium.png)

## Description

`puppet-modulator` (or `modulator` or `pm`) is a high level wrapper that allows to:

* quickly edit your module `metadata.json` content
* wrap `git-flow` with common Puppet module edition workflows

<br/>

It has been heavily inspired by the awesome [puppet blacksmith](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-blacksmith).

Compared to `blacksmith`, `modulator` comes as a standalone tool written in Go.
Hence, it does not depend on the module you're currently editing or on any Ruby / gem version or whatsoever.
