# Setting up the alias

`puppet-modulator` is a command that you may use very often and its name is quite long.

We recommend to setup the `pm` alias such as:

```bash
‚ùØ alias pm="puppet-modulator"
```

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i>
All the documentation will refer to the <pre>pm</pre> command alias.
</div>
