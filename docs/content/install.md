# Install instructions

You can install the pre-compiled binary (in several different ways) or compile from source.

Below you can find the steps for each of them.

## Install the pre-compiled binary

### DEB, RPM and APK packages

Download the `.deb`, `.rpm` or `.apk` packages from the [Releases page](https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/cc-in2p3-puppet-master-tools/puppet-modulator/-/releases) and install them with the appropriate tools.

### Manually

Download the pre-compiled binaries from the [Releases page](https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/cc-in2p3-puppet-master-tools/puppet-modulator/-/releases) and copy them to the desired location.

## Verifying the binaries

All artifacts are checksummed using `SHA-256` and the `checksum.txt` file can be found alongside the binaries and packages.
